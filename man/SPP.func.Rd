\title{Returns Species Values Necessary As Dependencies for Other Functions}
\usage{
SPP.func(SPP)
}
\arguments{
\item{SPP}{Species: use FVS species codes}
}
\value{
SPtype, sg, shade
}
\description{
This function returns species values which are dependencies for other
more complex functions. These values include whether a species is a hardwood or softwood,
a species standard gravity, and coeefients for shade, drought, waterlog, and wd.
Some of these coefficents may be valuable on their own, but they are grouped together to
simplify function calls for other more complex functions in this inventory package.
